# Heart SMD NE555
24 LEDs forming a LED-Heart driven by a NE555 bistable vibrator. A LED-Light runs around the heart. The speed of the running LED-light can be modified by the potentiomenter
This soldering Kit requires first experience in SMD-Soldering and is a very good practice for the size 0805.
